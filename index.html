        <p>Hello! my name is Nosipho Lukhele, I come from a family of four.
            I live in South Africa and I use to work as an AutoCad Draughtsperson. Now I am excited to start a new
            career
            as a Software Developer
            of which I am currently preparing for as I am studying towards my Degree with BYU.
            Besides that I love challenging myself physically.
